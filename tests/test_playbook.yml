# Simple wrapper to call the main playbook with 'ci_test' set to true.
# Because this particular playbook does not require dedicated test
# playbook due to its simplicity, its easier just to invoke the main
# one. This is also consistent and allows for future growth rather
# than using '-e' from the CI build specifications.
