# Sample CLI outputs with hashes
This folder contains a sample output folders which would typically be
contained with an archive after running the `racc` playbook. Each host
has a corresponding folder with date/time stamp containing output files
relevant to a specific playbook run. It also contains the optional
hash file on a per-device basis.
